<h1><strong>Grasshopper - Debug sayHello</strong></h1>

<h2><strong>Instructions:</strong></h2>

<p>The starship Enterprise has run into some problem when creating a program to greet everyone as they come aboard. It is your job to fix the code and get the program working again!</p>

<h2><strong>Output:</strong></h2>

<pre>
    <code>
Hello, Mr. Spock
    </code>
</pre>

<h2><strong>Solution #1:</strong></h2>

``` python
def say_hello(name):
    return f"Hello, {name}"
```

<h3><b>How did I do it?</b></h3>
<p>
    <ol>
    <li> Use an f-string to include the <code>name</code> argument inside the string.</li>
    <li>That's it!</li>
    </ol>
</p>

<h3><strong>What did I learn?</strong></h3>
<p>While I'm familiar with f-strings, it is always important to remember how convenient they are when comparing to previous available resources.</p>
