<h2><strong>What is CodeWars?</strong></h2>
In CodeWars, people get together to solve coding challenges from different programming languages;l in my case, I'm solving <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>SQL (PosgreSQL)</strong> katas. It's also a good platform to discuss different approaches to the same problem while learning new (and possibily more efficient) ways to code.</p>

<h2><strong>The Leveling System:</strong></h2>

<h2><strong>The Challenges:</strong></h2>
<p>Please take a look at each directory in this repo. I've organized it by the programming language and, inside each of it, you can find the challenges by level. In addition to the instructions and descriptions of each challenge, you'll find the solution for it, as well a few comments on how I tried to solve that particular kata and what I learned out of it.

<h2><strong>Observations:</strong></h2>
<p>Feel free to copy and do whatever comes into your mind with this repo. My goal here is to share what I've learned so far, and I know that sometimes we get stuck in a particular problem. I hope that my comments can help you to <em>think</em> on a particular language, understanding how it works. This is the way to get better!</p>
